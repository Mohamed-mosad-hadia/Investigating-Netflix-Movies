# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
task 1   Associate Data Scientist in Python track (Datacamp)


# Description

This Python code analyzes movie data from a Netflix-like dataset (presumably named netflix_data.csv) to explore the relationship between movie duration and release year. It then visualizes this relationship using a scatter plot and investigates whether there's a trend towards shorter movies over time.
